**Overview:**

Tables Used:

| Table | Why |
| ----- | --- |
| subscriptions | Contains each customer's subscription plan_id and start_date |
| plans | Contains information about each plan |

I solved this by:

1. Creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) called `customer_info_plans` that joins both the `subscription` and the `plans` tables together.

**SQL Statement:**
	
```sql	
WITH customer_info_plans AS (SELECT
  s.customer_id
  ,s.plan_id
  ,p.plan_name
  ,p.price
  ,s.start_date

  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions AS s
  LEFT JOIN foodie_fi.plans AS p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
                             
  ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date
)

SELECT *

FROM customer_info_plans
```

**Table Output:**

| customer_id | plan_id | plan_name     | price  | start_date |
